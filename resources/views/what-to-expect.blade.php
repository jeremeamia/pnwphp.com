                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <p>Pacific NorthWest PHP (PNWPHP) Conference maintains a friendly, 
                professional, and welcoming environment. Developers of all skill 
                levels are welcome. We have a <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of 
                Conduct</a>. We take all Code of Conduct reports seriously, and our Code 
                of Conduct will be enforced.</p>

                <h2>What To Bring</h2>
                <p><em>Bring your Identification</em>, as you'll need it for registration. A 
                wi-fi network is available, so you'll have access to the web.  
                There are some power outlets available, but we have to share. Try 
                to fully charge any of your devices before arriving.  Bring your 
                laptop, or your moleskine - however you enjoy taking notes.  We'll 
                be live blogging and tweeting, which we hope you'll help us with.  
                Other than that, just bring a desire to learn, and an open mind.</p>

                <h2>Getting to PNWPHP</h2>
                <p>Parking can be difficult in Downtown Seattle. We suggest taking 
                public transportation if you live nearby. Several bus routes, and 
                <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/light-rail/link-light-rail" >Link Light Rail</a> 
                have stops nearby. If you need to drive, try to 
                carpool if possible. This will cut down on traffic, and parking 
                issues. <a href="http://www.impacthubseattle.com/location">Get Directions</a> 
                to the conference venue -

                <h2>Arriving</h2>
                <p>When you arrive at the Impact Hub, the Main Entrance on 2nd Ave 
                S, is located just south of S Washington St. When you walk in, you 
                will see a registration table, which is where you check in.</p>

                <h2>Talks</h2>
                <p>The main event room is on the first floor, to the left of the elevator. 
                This is where the keynote will be held, as well as one of the 
                speaking tracks. Each talk room will be clearly labeled on the 
                schedule. If you have any questions about which room a certain talk 
                is in, stop by the registration table</p>

                <p>The talks will be accompanied by slides, and the speakers will 
                have microphones. If you need any visual or audio assistance, 
                please send us an email to let us know what you need. We will do 
                our best to assist you.</p>

                <h3>Unconference</h3>
                <p>As part of the conference, we will have an Un-Con track. This will allow
                people to share their ideas. This is a good opportunity who want to try
                public speaking. It's also a great way to further discuss ideas that
                have been raised in previous sessions.</p>

                <h2>Food and Drink</h2>
                <p>Lunch will be provided on-site. If you have any dietary 
                restrictions, please let us know when you purchase your ticket. If 
                you have already purchased your ticket, please send us an email to 
                let us know about your dietary restrictions. We will try to work 
                with your dietary restrictions. We will do our best to accommodate 
                you, but we may not be able to.</p>

                <h2>Getting Help</h2>
                <p>If you need assistance at any time, any one of our organizers 
                would be happy to help you out. The organizers will be moving 
                around the venue, but the easiest place to find them will be at the 
                registration table.</p>
